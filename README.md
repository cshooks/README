# cshooks

This is the organization to keep repositories for Computer Science related React Hooks.

# Plans

## Data Structures

I will be creating hooks for `trie`, `max/min heaps`, etc
They will be aptly like `useTrie`, `useMaxHeap`, `useMinHeap`, etc.

## Algorithms

Algorithm related hooks for Graph algorithms such as, `Dijkstra`, `Bellman-Ford`, `LRU (Least Recently Used)`.
They will be aptly like `useDijkstra`, `useBellmanFord`, `useLRU`, etc
